# Ikes-Menu-Project
Quick python script for getting all of the menu items and their ingredients from the Ike's website (a local sandwich shop with a LOT of options https://www.ikessandwich.com/). Allows the user to input ingredients they want in their sandwich and presents all of the sandwiches offered by Ike's with those ingredients. Simple GUI as well (this is my first ever attempt at making a GUI).

-Ikes_GUI is the script for the GUI the executable in Ikes_Final is based off of; this will always be the most updated version of the script; it will do the same thing as the executable, just with the extra step of having to run it :).

-Ikes_Final is the executable version of the Ikes_GUI script; download the folder to get that.

-Ikes_Menu_Processor is the code before I began adding any GUI; this has a bunch of warnings and is done comepletely in the console.

Possible bug: the website changes a bit when they close and open; I havent been able to identify the exact time it changes at so it might not work for an hour sometime around 9-10am and again sometime around 9pm

Using this opportunity to understand Git -- apologies if I'm ignorant to any GitHub standards.
